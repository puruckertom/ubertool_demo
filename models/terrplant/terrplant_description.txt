The purpose of this model is to provide an upper bound estimate of exposure of birds and mammals to pesticides through drinking water alone. This model is intended for use in problem formulation to determine whether or not drinking water exposure alone is a potential pathway of concern. This does not aggregate drinking water exposure with other exposure routes (i.e., diet, inhalation, dermal).
