<p>The primary function of AgDRIFT is to calculate the downward drift and deposition of pesticides and the magnitude of buffer zones needed to protect sensitive aquatic and terrestrial habitats. The Tier I model methodology uses different application type and drop size distributions to yield a conservative exposure estimate. Application type options in AgDRIFT include aerial, ground, and orchard/airblast. The aerial application model of spray drift is based on both mechanistic models and field data. The model outputs for ground and orchard/airblast models are based solely on field data. The estimated offsite deposition is used as the application rate input for T-Rex.</p>

<p>The purpose of this model is to calculate the residues on avian and mammalian food items along with the dissipation rate of a chemical applied to foliar surfaces (for single or multiple applications) in order to estimate acute and reproductive risk quotients. LD50 ft-2 values are calculated for both broadcast and banded (granular and liquid) applications using an adjusted LD50 method. The results are presented by weight class for various sized birds and mammals for each type of application. Avian and mammalian risk quotients are also calculated for seed treatment applications to various crop seeds. </p>
